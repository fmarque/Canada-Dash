* Install Plugins (Optional): If you want to enhance JSON support, you can install plugins. To do this, navigate to Plugins in the settings/preferences window.

* Search for JSON Plugins: In the Plugins window, type "JSON" in the search box to find available JSON-related plugins. Some popular plugins include "JSON Formatter" or "GsonFormat".
